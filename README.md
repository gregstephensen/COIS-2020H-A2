Greg - I'm looking at collision resolution schemes. Linear shouldn't be too difficult since it just takes the item and looks for the next availiable spot whenever a collision happens. Quadratic has a simple formula that increments everytime a collision happens. But needs to eventually be able to double the size to the next prime number, and then mod that size to get the new positions. You have the prime number checker which is good.
